This is a good strategy within a fully end-game squad in wich everyone is experienced, as to maximise the team DPS (SnS and LBG can take just skilled, watch out to save squad members, while dishing a high DPS still for LBG, and fully focus on inflicting paralysis for SnS).</td></tr>

The skill gives much more stability and sustainability for the support role (and thus, for the team), as you get to have much more than 3 shots only. In extra of lifepowders, you can now use potions, mega potions and herbs to have a maximum healing capacity on a long period of time.<br>On top of that, you can now assure a buff support role on top of heal support role, as consuming demon/armor potions/pills and fruits will affect everyone.<br>At last but not least, Wide-Area affects Espinas Anti-Venom, which heals off the team from Espinas blight, but also gives the whole squad an insane 40% damage reduction that lasts for a minute, making this skill a precious asset on Hunter's Road.<br>※ On Hunter's Road, ALWAYS pick Z Espinas.

You are not going to use those separately without Soul Up, even on weapons that do not look like support weapons at all by appearance (Gunlance, HBG..).<br><br>Red Soul is the offensive side of the combo: it will provide +100 True Raw to the squad (including the skill user), and remove stamina consumption when running with unsheathed weapons. Blue Soul is the defensive side of the combo: it will provide +200 Defense to everyone, health recovery effects, and removes abnormal effects when triggered.<br>The idea is to slot in Reinforcement-10 as to have Blue Soul, alongside Blazing Grace that provides Red Soul, and finish with Soul Up as a Zenith skill.<br>One single activation (from hitting a player, or use a sonic bomb) will then trigger all 3 skills at once, for every players in the squad (even if only one player got hit), for about 2 minutes.<br>※ You can track if Souls are active next to the players name, symbolized by a red fist for Red Soul, and a blue fist for Blue Soul.<br><br><h class="gfg">SnS</h> makes a very good use of this combo, as paired to the 10% natural damage increase to a paralysed monster, giving the squad extra attacks (and not a small amount that is) greatly buffs the damage performance.<br><h class="gfg">HH</h> got a sonic bomb move integrated to its moveset, the Souls combo make a great use of it. This gives HH the opportunity to remove abnormal status at any time, and provides easy Red/Blue soul. Red Soul paired to HH Attack buff gives near 25% attack to each hunter in the squad. In a 4 members squad, this simply translates to HH owning 75% of the squad attack, on top of its own attack buffed by 25%, which is why HH is the only weapon that should give entire dedication to buffing the team. Blue Soul paired to HH Defense Buff give around 1k Defense on Hunter's Road, which is the closest of Halk's Pot you can get on Hunter's Road (aside Espinas Anti-Venom buff). While HH is incredible at buffing the team, its worth noting that it is one of the worst weapons to heal the team with, despite the HH stereotypes. HH users should always look to first buff the team, then attack aggressively the monster while debuffing its hitzones.<br>
																																																												<h class="gfg">GL</h> and <h class="gfg">HBG</h> naturally need Blazing Grace in their set as to both buff their core mechanics. This means they have Red Soul for free in the set, and without any support context, Soul Up is a Zenith skill they want to have in their set as it naturally gives them +100 True Raw. This means that just from their synergy with Blazing Majesty, they gain the possibility to passively buff the whole team. GL having a very long range when using Heatblade mode, and HBG being a ranged weapon, they both hit other players very easily. On top of it, HBG can also make use of demon & armor ammos for extra buffs. However both weapon will only use Red Soul paired to Soul Up, buffing the attack only, as Blue Soul is not required for their set. If they have room for an extra skill, Blue Soul is to highly consider.<br><h class="gfg">LBG</h> does not need Blazing Majesty, and a LBG set always focus its own damage before the team. However, Vigorous Up buffs gunners weapons by 50 raw instead of 100 for blademasters'. This means Soul Up is a solid Zenith skill option for gunners as to get more attack than with Vigorous Up, and Blue Soul's Defense increase is always a nice touch for gunners. Like HBG, LBG has access to demon/armor ammos, and on top of that can fill a heal support role, so it can fully exploit its support role and extend it to buff support. However this will require a fully dedicated support set.</td></tr>
