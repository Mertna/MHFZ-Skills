However it is difficult to play, as it has near no mobility, evasions (rolling is your only option), and most attacks lock you in place and make you quite vulnerable. The Horn should always have Red and Purple notes, followed by either Yellow, Green or Blue note.<br>※ Buffing the team is not an excuse to use a passive gameplay. Any HH user should always stay very aggressive and near the monster, else they can end up being a dead weight for the team.<br>※ While HH built-in buffs are the best in the game, these buffs can get even higher with a buff support oriented build.
